MRECWBookstore is a full-featured web application built using Django, designed for managing an online bookstore. This project includes separate modules for administrators and users, providing capabilities like book browsing, searching, cart management, ordering, and user profile handling. The admin panel allows easy management of books, orders, and users.
This project was developed as part of an academic assignment or portfolio project by students of Malla Reddy Engineering College for Women (MRECW) to gain hands-on experience with web development and database integration using Django and SQLite.
